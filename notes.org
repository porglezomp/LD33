* Theme: You Are the Monster

* Ideas
  - You are the monster in the center of the temple, you manipulate people
    to get them to give you more sacrifices
    - Have to keep them happy, but also keep yourself fed
    - Tentacles to grab priests roaming around
    - Shoot column of fire!
  - Hide to jump out and scare people
  - Controlling the big bad corporation
    - Try to extract all the resource
    - Poison all the habitats
    - Lay pipeline that destroys stuff
    - Fracking to poison water supplies
  - HP Lovecraft inspired - but how ???
  - Calvin and Hobbes style "get the kid out of bed" monster
  - Simple game made monster themed
    - Space Invaders
  - Vampire sneak around and bite people
    - Monaco style
    - Avoid bright lights, avoid being seen
    - Bite everyone as fast as possible
    - Network leaderboard? Multiple levels?
  - Lemmings like --- can of Monster Energy as a powerup
  - Jekyll and Hyde
  - You Are the Monster Truck

* Selected: Vampire!
  - Points system
    - Pints system :: heyooooooo
    - Speed :: causes the player to get them selves into trouble, which is fun
    - 
  - Turn into a bat for a short amount of time
    - One / reduced health while bat
    - Can fit in small spaces / fly over gaps
    - If anyone sees you transform they're alerted
  - Stay in the dark
    - Turn into dust if you're exposed to *direct sunlight*
    - Bright lights slowly hurt you, make it more obvious you're a vampire
  - For some reason people take a while to realize that that guy in a cape
    is a vampire. They're so silly!
